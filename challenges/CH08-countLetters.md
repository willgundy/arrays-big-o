Implement `countLetters`
---

## Rules

Use a JavaScript object to track your letter counts

## Challenge

Write a function `countLetters` that takes an array of letters, and returns a dictionary (object) with a key for each letter and a corresponding value that is a count of how many times that letter appears in the array

```js
function countLetters(letters) {
```

> **You can assume valid inputs and that all letters are lower case**

## Test Cases

Input:

```js
['a', 'c', 'c', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'b', 'd', 'c']
```

Output:

```js
{
  a: 2,
  c: 4,
  b: 3,
  d: 1
}
```
